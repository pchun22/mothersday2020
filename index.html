        Dear Mom,<br />
        Happy Mother’s Day! Thank you being the best mom a son could ask for. I’m beyond grateful to have such a fun and caring mom. Most moms don’t learn tik-tok dances with their son, send them memes and funny articles, crazily style their hair, or tell borderline inappropriate jokes. You are truly something special. You’ve always taken care the best care of me. Thank you for being there to talk to me when I’m away at college whether it be about school/job stress or social life. You give the best advice and I know that I can talk to you about any problem and feel better about it afterwards. Sometimes I don’t immediately agree with your advice but I’ve come to understand that you know best and think carefully about what you advise. Thank you for filming my dances and always making me food to fuel me through learning to code and dance. I’m grateful I can do whatever and that you will be there in my corner to cheer me on. The reason I am where I am is because you raised, supported, and encouraged me constantly. I love you. <br />
        Love, <br />
        Parker

        Dear Mom,<br />
        HAPPY MOTHER’S DAY! I am so grateful to have such a bright, witty, weird, kind, pretty, young mom like you! I hope you enjoy the presentation and all of our favorite memories with you. Today is your day! I hope you relax and take the time to yourself because you have done so much for us. From brushing our teeth when we were young, cooking meals for us everyday, dancing for us on the living room dance floor, you have always done so much for us. Thank you for taking good care of me, and putting everyone else’s happiness before yours. Life is so much more bright and exciting with you in my life and I am so happy God gave me you to be my mom. I know sometimes I make you mad, but you always find a way to forgive me and deal with me… thank you! I hope you know how much we appreciate you, and we hope this day goes out to you and that you realize how much you do for us, and know we realize it too and are so grateful. We couldn’t ask for a better mother. You are the heart of the family, and our safe harbor. You keep us together, and bring so much laughter. Happy Mother’s Day! Love you so much mom!<br />
        Love,<br />
        Noe<br />
        P.S. Bella and Eli say Happy Mothers Day, and Bella says thank you for letting her scratch up your legs
